Twitter Tag Cloud 
=================
This application captures tweets from twitter, stores it in Couchbase Server and generates a tag cloud out of the keywords. 

After installing Couchbase Server 2.0 and doing the manual steps described below, run tstream.py (with your twitter API creds).
Load tagcloud.html to render a tagcloud out of the data collected.

Pre-Requisites:
---------------
Twitter Streaming API (Your twitter API credentials need to be entered in tstream.py)
Tweepy (Python libraries for twitter)
Couchbase Server 2.0 (Developer Preview build will suffice)

Description
-----------
The app is written in Python and consists of mainly two simple components:

tstream.py:
A small service based on tweepy that implements a StreamListener which inserts incoming data in the Couchbase Server. Here you can also set filter terms. This example uses mostly terms related to “Big Data”.

tagcloud.html:
A few lines of HTML and JavaScript to render the tag cloud. 

Manual steps
------------
(1) Install Couchbase Server Latest Build 

(2) Create Views
You need to create a Couchbase server 2.0 view called hashTagsByName with the following map and reduce functions:
To learn how to create Couchbase Server 2.0 views check out http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-views.html

Map function
------------
function (doc) {
  doc.entities.hashtags.forEach(function(htag) {
    emit(htag.text.toUpperCase(), null)
  });
}

Reduce function
---------------
_count

(3) Edit tstream.py to modify the Couchbase Database Credentials and Twitter API Keys
(4) Install all necessary tstream.py dependant libraries such as tweepy, python SDK for Couchbase Server 2.0
(5) Run tweepy.py and use tagcloud.html to view the results. Enjoy!
